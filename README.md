# PredictingHousePrices


This predictive model uses xgboost to predict housing prices based on numerical data. 

## What I learnt

* First order vs. Second order optimzation and alongside its computational expense
* Hyperparameter tuning; Maximum depth of tree, lamda and alpha term, maximum number of nodes
* Benifits of adding in the regularization term to prevent overfitting
* How to validate the model using cross validation
